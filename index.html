                <h3>Recommendations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Change sens to 0.7</li>
                    <li>Lower resolution and settings till you are consistnetly over 144fps</li>
                    <li>Buy armour with all SMGS and Rifle buys</li>
                    <li>Always prioritize guns and armour over utility</li>
                    <li>Always buy body armour on pistol rounds</li>
                    <li>Buy as a team, take a look at what kind of weapons your teammates have and make sure you are keeping up.</li>
                    <li>Focus on 1 angle at a time and never leave yourself exposed to a dangerous angle</li>

                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>
                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <p>Starting: CT</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol utility, nade ramp and flash over middle with no impact and the dangers of buying utility on pistol round, slight overflicking on the first enemy could be because I asked him to lower his sens during warmup, but I do recommend significantly lowering sens. W</li>
                    <li>Utility, this was a slightly weird buy as you were the only player on your team without an upgraded pistol or smg and this meant you coudn’t fight at all during this round and the utility you did throw had low impact on the round win. W</li>
                    <li>SMG buy, weird buy as you had enough money to do a full buy especially since you saved so much from last round and the rest of your team had rifles, this meant that the first engagement you did get into against a rifle you lost even though you had hit him 6 times with your smg. L</li>
                    <li>Mp9 buy, buying an smg without armour is never advisable as any damage you take will result in you taking significant damage and aim punch making every engagement very difficult to win, fortunately you caught the enemy peeking palace completely off-guard and managed to frag him but unfortunately due to no armour you died almost instantly afterwards. L</li>
                    <li>usp utility, interesting choice to spend so much on utility without buying upgraded pistols in these cases I recommend getting a p250 or a deagle instead as utility if used incorrectly if used at all could actually disadvantage your team or have absolutely no impact whereas a pistol will always have the potential of getting you a kill and doing damage. W</li>
                    <li>M4 buy, when going up ladder you did so a bit slowly this made it so you were late to getting on A belcony, afterwards your attention was split between ramp and palace when it should have been completely focused on palace and this led to you dying when you check on ramp from a guy palace. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle, good attempt at going for the flank but when you were flanking you did not expect them to be holding it which led to you getting killed by someone who you were not looking for. L</li>
                    <li>mp9 no armour, this should have been a full buy as you had enough money and your team did a full buy also having no armour meant you were susceptible to aim punch and quickly dying. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, first full buy of the game, unfortunately you got caught off-guard by the enemies pushing middle while being distracted by the execute on A site. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, interesting position ticket early round as it is usually quite a difficult angle to play with a rifle, when playing stairs you were peeking dangerously as you were top stairs looking into ramp, and the enemies had middle control which is why you died from them pushing connector. L</li>
                    <li>MP9 no armour, again with the no armour and upgraded weapon, a bit of awkward movement into middle led to you being chased and killed by other enemies. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, changing positions and going to B, crosshair placement from back site into apps was too close, and when going through deathhole you need to make sure you clear the right side as that is where the enemy will be 90% of the time. L</li>
                    <li>MP9 buy, dangerous flash middle as if there was someone bench or chair they would have been able to shoot you once you threw that flash, good damage and nice kill and nearly a double kill. L</li>
                    <li>M4 armour, when rotating make sure you look at any possible positions you could get shot from and only ever pull out your knife when you know there is absolutely no chance of you getting into an engagement. L</li>
                    <li>M4 no armour but a lot of utility, I think not buying armour here was a mistake as you always buy armour when you buy a rifle as you saw you died in 3 shots instead of 4 which is significantly important when taking fights. L</li>
                    <li>T side Pistol utility, unfortunately, you died from a flank and died in only 3 shots (none were headshots) whereas usually it will take 6-10 shots with a usp no headshot.</li>
                    <li>Mac-10 no armour + utility, I would always recommend buying armour over utility as it will have more impact on the amount of damage you can do before you die, I also never recommend jumping into an angle as it takes a very long time before you are completely accurate after you land from a jump. W</li>
                    <li>Mac-10 no armour + utility, slightly incorrect call as you said “all of them are ct rotating behind” when they were actually in T spawn fortunately your team understood and no-one was caught off-guard, due to you having no armour again you died to a usp spamming you in the stomach a couple times. W</li>
                    <li>AWP buy, nice kill on the enemy flanking, although when getting onto site you should have had your crosshair on jungle just incase he decided to peek and you had a good idea when you fake planted and went for the peek but it wasn’t executed well as you thought the enemy would be further away which they were not, and you missed 2 awp shots on the enemy with slight overflicks due to the higher sens. L</li>
                    <li>save + utility, when rotating into apps you didn’t expect the enemy to be so close which led to you not being ready for the fight. L</li>
                    <li>AK no armour, I would recommend downgrading to a SMG in order to buy armour as it stand you with an ak can die in 3 bullets to a usp, but good job getting 1 kill. L</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you during that game,did you get the positions you wanted? and were you comfortable in real life? <br> Pretty comfortable and got to do what I wanted to do.</li>
                    <li>How did your crosshair placement feel? <br> Not on point and constantly off the enemy.</li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during flicks? <br> Flicks felt normal </li>
                    <li>How did your overall aim mechanics feel, like spraying, preaiming, peeking angles ect? <br> Sprayed poorly that match and missed a lot of duels during that match, but slightly over confident and overcommited to fights</li>
                    <li>How did your movement and rotations feel? <br> Tried to play Anchor and tried to make sure that there was no chance of a fake occurring</li>
                    <li>How did your positioning feel? <br> Often in very obvious places and most the of the time didn’t have very good positioning.</li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel? <br> I did try use some lineup or often sometimes just didn’t land where I wanted it and I wasn’t too upset with how I used my utility during that match</li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel, did you give consistent calls throughout the entire game and were you calling the correct positions and giving correct information? <br> For most of the game I was giving fair and decent callouts but there were a few times I gave out horrible callouts and sometimes made teammates make unfortunate plays</li>
                    <li>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again? <br> I would say I wasn’t really a fan of any of them and most had some negative connotations.</li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing could you immediately improve on for the next game you play? <br> Learning lineups, for utility</li>
                </ul>
